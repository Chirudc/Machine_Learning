# Cluistering_Analysis_Project_Using_K-Means_and_PCA
This project explores unsupervised learning techniques for clustering, implemented in a Jupyter Notebook environment, using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset. It applies K-Means clustering to categorize tumors based on their features. The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps such as standardization and dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), reducing the original 30 features to 2 principal components for better clustering performance. The optimal number of clusters is determined using Silhouette Score and the Elbow Method. The objective is to analyze how well clustering can differentiate between benign and malignant tumors without using predefined labels.

This project evaluates clustering effectiveness using visualizations and performance metrics, comparing results before and after PCA application. The findings indicate that PCA enhances clustering quality, leading to more distinct groupings. After clustering, the Diagnosis column is reintroduced to validate results, showing that Cluster 1 predominantly contains benign tumors, while Cluster 0 consists mainly of malignant tumors. This study highlights the potential of unsupervised learning in medical data classification, demonstrating how K-Means clustering combined with PCA can effectively group medical data and support early detection efforts.
