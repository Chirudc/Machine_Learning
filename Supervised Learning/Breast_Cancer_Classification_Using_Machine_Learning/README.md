# Breast_Cancer_Classification_-Using_Machine_Learning
This project focuses on classifying tumors as either benign or malignant using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset. Two machine learning models, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) with an RBF kernel, were trained to predict tumor malignancy. The dataset was preprocessed by encoding the diagnosis column (1 for malignant, 0 for benign) and standardizing the feature set to ensure optimal model performance. The dataset was then split into 80% training and 20% testing to evaluate model accuracy.

The Logistic Regression model achieved 97.37% accuracy, with a precision of 97.56%, recall of 95.24%, and an F1 score of 96.39%. The SVM model slightly outperformed it with 98.25% accuracy, a perfect precision of 100%, recall of 95.24%, and an F1 score of 97.56%. Both models performed well, but SVM was superior due to its perfect precision, meaning it made no false positive predictions. The analysis included confusion matrices to visualize the classification performance. While both models were highly accurate, SVM was found to be the preferable model due to its higher precision and overall accuracy, making it a better choice for tumor classification.
