# Auto_MPG_Project_using_Linear_Regression_ML
This project focuses on predicting vehicle fuel efficiency (MPG - miles per gallon) using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is the Auto MPG dataset, which contains information about various car models, including engine specifications, weight, acceleration, and horsepower. By applying linear regression, we aim to analyze how these factors impact fuel efficiency and build a predictive model to estimate a carâ€™s MPG. The insights gained can help automobile manufacturers, policymakers, and consumers make informed decisions about fuel-efficient vehicles.

The machine learning pipeline involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. Various regression techniques, such as simple and multiple linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods, are tested to improve prediction accuracy. The project also evaluates the impact of features like engine displacement, weight, and horsepower on fuel economy, providing valuable insights into vehicle performance. By leveraging data-driven approaches, this project contributes to optimizing fuel consumption, reducing environmental impact, and advancing sustainable automotive technologies.
