# Text_Classification_and_Sentiment_Analysis_on_IMDb_Movie_Reviews_using_Machine_Learning
The project focuses on text classification using the IMDb Movie Reviews Dataset, implemented in a Jupyter Notebook environment. It involves preprocessing text data, vectorizing it using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), and applying multiple classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines. The objective is to compare the performance of these models in terms of accuracy and other evaluation metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score. The dataset used in the project appears to be related to sentiment analysis, where the goal is to classify text into predefined categories.

The workflow includes data cleaning, text normalization, and feature extraction before training the models. Performance evaluation is conducted using suitable metrics and visualizations to compare the models' effectiveness. The results help in determining the best-performing classifier for the given task. The project highlights the importance of text preprocessing and feature engineering in improving classification accuracy. The insights gained from the study can be useful in applications such as sentiment analysis, spam detection, and topic classification
